# GTM Bulk Cookie Setter Tag Template

## Overview

This Google Tag Manager (GTM) custom tag template allows you to set multiple cookies dynamically based on a table of cookie names and their corresponding values. You can configure cookie expiration, path, and domain, with advanced options to skip undefined or empty values and to refresh cookie lifespan upon each tag execution.

Developed by Jude for DumbData.
